# PSM_App
This is a simple app which i created. In this app you can create account and add recipes to global database. And when you will be hungry you can just enter what you have in fridge and app will find what you can do with these components. Simple and useful :)
To create this app i used:
- Firebase authentication,
- Firbase realtime database,
- NavigationDrawerLayout and Fragments.

Here some screenshots:
